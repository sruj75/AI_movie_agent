Task planning and orchestration can greatly enhance the robustness and flexibility of your agent’s workflow. Right now, the code you have simply sets up a single `LLMAgent` instance with a system prompt and a couple of tools, and then uses `.chat()` to handle user queries. While this works for straightforward requests, more complex queries may require multi-step reasoning, tool chaining, or the ability to break down a complex instruction into simpler subtasks.

Here are a few approaches and best practices for introducing more advanced task planning and orchestration:

### 1. Structured Reasoning with ReACT or Plan-and-Execute Patterns  
Modern agent frameworks often employ a pattern where the agent first "thinks aloud" (chain-of-thought) to decide on the next steps before acting. For instance, LlamaIndex (and other frameworks like LangChain) can use ReACT or Plan-and-Execute strategies:

- **ReACT Pattern**:  
  The agent first reasons about the user’s query, decides if it needs to use a tool, then executes the tool call. After getting the tool’s result, it continues reasoning and finally provides the user an answer. This pattern is already partially in use with `LLMAgent`, but you can strengthen it by providing a more detailed system prompt that encourages structured reasoning, or by using different agent classes that LlamaIndex provides.

- **Plan-and-Execute Pattern**:  
  With more recent versions of LlamaIndex, you can leverage the `PlanAndExecute` agents. This involves:
  1. **Planning Step**: The LLM produces a structured plan of what needs to be done.  
  2. **Execution Step**: The LLM (or a subordinate agent) follows the plan, calling tools step-by-step.  
  
  This approach helps when tasks are more involved. For example, if a user wants to find a movie, check multiple showtimes, apply a filter, and then book tickets, the agent can first create a "to-do list" (plan) and then execute it in sequence.

### 2. Using a Router Agent for Complex Workflows  
If you have multiple tools or different specialized indices (for different domains), you can use a router agent or a top-level planner agent that decides which agent or tool should handle a particular subtask. For instance:
- One agent/index could specialize in movies and showtimes.
- Another agent/index might specialize in user profile and preferences.
- The router agent then decides which agent to query first, integrates their responses, and orchestrates a multi-agent workflow.

### 3. Custom Prompts for Better Task Decomposition  
The system prompt you provide can include instructions for task decomposition. For example:

```text
System Prompt:
You are a personal movie booking assistant. When the user asks a complex question, break it down into smaller tasks. Reason through each step before calling any tool. Explain your reasoning to yourself first (but do not reveal it to the user), then take action by calling the appropriate tool. After obtaining tool results, continue reasoning until you have a final answer.
```

Encouraging the LLM to outline steps explicitly can result in better task orchestration.

### 4. Leveraging LlamaIndex’s Tool and Agent Framework Enhancements  
Check the LlamaIndex documentation for updated agent abstractions. The library offers components that:
- Automatically parse user intents.
- Decide if a tool call is needed.
- Keep track of previous steps.
  
By using these built-in frameworks, you can reduce manual orchestration and let the agent handle complexity internally.

### 5. External Orchestration Layers  
If you want more control, consider an external orchestration layer:
- **Workflow Engines**: Tools like Airflow or Prefect could orchestrate more complex sequences (though this may be overkill for a simple chatbot).
- **Intermediate Memory & State Management**: Maintain a state in a database (e.g., Supabase) that tracks what steps have been completed. The agent can query this state to decide the next step.

### Example of a More Advanced Flow  
1. **User Query**: "I’d like to watch a sci-fi movie tonight, can you recommend something and help me book it?"
2. **Agent Plan** (internal reasoning):  
   - Identify user’s genre preference: sci-fi.  
   - Query index to find sci-fi movies available.  
   - Present top choices to user.  
   - Once user picks a movie, call `check_showtimes` tool to find showtimes.  
   - Ask user which showtime they prefer.  
   - Call `book_tickets` tool.  
   - Confirm booking.
   
3. **Execution**: The agent follows the plan step-by-step. First it queries the index for sci-fi movies, then suggests options, then after user chooses, it uses `check_showtimes`, etc.

By incorporating these approaches—either using the built-in Plan-and-Execute style agents in LlamaIndex or introducing a more structured approach in your prompts—you’ll have a more robust and maintainable orchestration and task planning system that can handle complex, multi-step user requests effectively.
