To develop an automated movie ticket booking system that integrates theater manager inputs via a Supabase database, automates the booking process using LlamaIndex workflows, and provides a WhatsApp interface for user interactions, follow these steps:

**1. Setting Up Supabase for Theater Manager Data**

- **Purpose**: Store and manage movie schedules, seat availability, and pricing information provided by theater managers.

- **Implementation**:
  - Create a new project in the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/).
  - Define tables for movies, showtimes, seats, and bookings.
  - Use Supabase's RESTful API or client libraries to allow theater managers to input and update data.

**2. Integrating Supabase with LlamaIndex**

- **Purpose**: Enable LlamaIndex to access and process data stored in Supabase for workflow automation.

- **Implementation**:
  - Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install llama-index supabase
    ```
  - Configure the connection to your Supabase database:
    ```python
    from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext
    from llama_index.vector_stores import SupabaseVectorStore

    # Replace with your Supabase connection details
    supabase_url = 'https://your-project.supabase.co'
    supabase_key = 'your-anon-key'
    supabase_schema = 'public'

    vector_store = SupabaseVectorStore(
        supabase_url=supabase_url,
        supabase_key=supabase_key,
        supabase_schema=supabase_schema,
        table_name='movie_data'  # Table to store vector embeddings
    )

    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)
    index = VectorStoreIndex([], storage_context=storage_context)
    ```
    This setup allows LlamaIndex to store and retrieve vector embeddings directly from Supabase. 

**3. Developing the Booking Workflow with LlamaIndex**

- **Purpose**: Automate the ticket booking process, including searching for available tickets, selecting seats, and processing payments.

- **Implementation**:
  - Define the workflow steps:
    ```python
    from llama_index.workflow import Workflow, step, StartEvent, StopEvent

    class BookingWorkflow(Workflow):
        @step
        async def search_tickets(self, event: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
            # Logic to search for available tickets using Supabase data
            available_tickets = "List of available tickets"
            return StopEvent(result=available_tickets)

        @step
        async def select_seats(self, event: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
            # Logic for seat selection
            selected_seats = "Selected seats"
            return StopEvent(result=selected_seats)

        @step
        async def process_payment(self, event: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
            # Logic to process payment
            payment_status = "Payment processed successfully"
            return StopEvent(result=payment_status)

    # Initialize and run the workflow
    workflow = BookingWorkflow()
    result = await workflow.run()
    print(result)
    ```
    Each step interacts with the Supabase database to retrieve or update information as needed.

**4. Deploying the Workflow with LlamaDeploy**

- **Purpose**: Deploy the booking workflow as a scalable microservice.

- **Implementation**:
  - Install LlamaDeploy:
    ```bash
    pip install llama-deploy
    ```
  - Deploy the workflow:
    ```python
    from llama_deploy import deploy_workflow

    # Deploy the booking workflow
    deploy_workflow(BookingWorkflow)
    ```
    This command deploys the `BookingWorkflow` as a microservice, enabling it to handle booking requests in a production environment. 

**5. Creating a WhatsApp Interface for User Interaction**

- **Purpose**: Allow users to interact with the booking system via WhatsApp.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use a service like Twilio to integrate WhatsApp messaging.
  - Set up a webhook to receive messages from users.
  - Process incoming messages and trigger the appropriate steps in the `BookingWorkflow`.
  - Send responses back to users via WhatsApp.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive movie ticket booking system that integrates theater manager inputs via Supabase, automates the booking process with LlamaIndex workflows, and provides a user-friendly interface through WhatsApp.
