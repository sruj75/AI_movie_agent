Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Ticket Booking System or Local Theaters

Introduction
The AI-Powered Ticket Booking System aims to modernize and streamline the ticket booking experience for local theaters in Bangalore. Leveraging familiar platforms like WhatsApp, an intuitive web dashboard, and advanced AI-powered features, the solution caters to both theater managers and customers who prefer traditional ticketing methods. By integrating features like natural language processing (NLP), payment gateways, and multi-modal interaction, the product bridges the gap between traditional methods and digital convenience.

Problem
1. Many local theaters in Bangalore lack online booking systems, relying instead on manual ticket sales that require patrons to queue for tickets.
2. A significant portion of the population, especially older adults and less tech-savvy individuals, prefers traditional methods or uses platforms like WhatsApp over apps such as BookMyShow.
3. Theater managers often lack the technical expertise or resources to adopt complex SaaS solutions for managing bookings and schedules.

Solution
The proposed solution involves:
1. A WhatsApp-based ticket booking system that allows users to interact in their mother tongue using text or voice commands.
2. A simple web dashboard for theater managers to manage showtimes and bookings, integrated with IMDB/TMDB API for easy movie data retrieval.
3. A secure, AI-powered backend to handle customer queries, movie recommendations, and ticket purchases, culminating in a QR code for theater entry.
